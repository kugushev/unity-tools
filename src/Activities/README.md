# Activities

An "intelligence int the world" engine. Allows developer to assign multiple possible activities or interactions to one or several objects and get all possible interactions for 2 objects.

# How to use
- Put InteractionsManager to a game object
- Add your custom interactions to the same game object. Each interaction has to inherit InteractionAsync or InteractionSync classes
- Use methods from InteractionsManager to get all possible pairs of intractable objects
